In October 2017 we reported on figures showing <a href="http://birminghameastside.com/2017/10/09/birmingham-immigration-checks-netting-more-brits-than-any-other-nationality/">British people being stopped by immigration officers over the past five years. In Birmingham, Britons were one out of every four questioned.</a>

# Get the data
The data was obtained as part of a nationwide investigation by <a href="https://thebristolcable.org/2017/10/brits-stopped-checked-immigration-crimes-cant-commit/">The Bristol Cable</a> and <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-10-09/review-homeoffice-immigration-checks">The Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a>. The Home Office only released the figures after seven-month working on a freedom of information request.

The files below show the information used by the Birmingham Eastside team to create the visualisation.
